Selection Sort is the most simplest sorting technique.
A simple Selection Sort works on the basic concept of ->

For an array at index 'i', find the smallest element in array 
from i till the end of the array. 

##Algorithm
- For the index 'i' from 0 to length of array-1
- Assume the index with the minimum element to be 'i'
- Now for the index 'j' from i+1 to length of array-1
- If the element at 'j' is less than the minimum element, assign minimum element the value 'j'
- Swap the element at i and element at minimum index

##Performance
- Time Complexity 
O(n^2)
- Space Complexity
O(n)

#Improvement
There are a lot of ways to optimize the selection sort algorithm to reduce its time complexity.
After learning sorting methods, come back to Selection Sort and try to reduce the time complexity.
